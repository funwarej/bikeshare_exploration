## Author : James Funware West


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset is for February 2019.
The data can be gotten from the sources below :
- Website: http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/
- Systems Data Page: http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data
- Data being shared: Trip, Station, Membership, Weather, Bike and Dock Availability


## Summary of Findings

## Conclusions
After analysis, the following findings were recorded:

1. There is no distinct difference in behaviour between genders recorded in the dataset, although female users recorded longer trip duration compared to other genders.

2. Majority of the users are male users, and over 90% of users are subscribers.

3. Most users are around the age of 25 - 45.

4. The bikeshare service records a lot of trips during the week and less trips during weekends.

5. Majority of the trips are started in the rush hour of the morning and the evening, this shows that a great percentage of users use the service for transit to work.

6. The behaviour of subscribers remains constant all through the week in terms of trip duration and only slightly increases on weekends. Meanwhile, customers record longer trips during weekends.

7. Customers use the service for leisure.


## Key Insights for Presentation
For my presentation, i focused on the different usertypes and the factors that affect their behaviour. I start off with univariate plots showing the gender, usertype proportion in our data and the age distribution in the data across usertypes. I also show the distribution of trip duration in the dataset. I moved further to show the busiest stations (Top 10)

Afterwards, i investigated the behaviour of the different usertypes with regards to trip duration, day of the week and start hour of the trip.
